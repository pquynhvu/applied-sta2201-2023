## Question 1

Consider the happiness example from the lecture, with 118 out of 129 women indicating they are happy. We are interested in estimating $\theta$, which is the (true) proportion of women who are happy. Calculate the MLE estimate $\hat{\theta}$ and 95% confidence interval. 

```{r}
y <- 118 # number of successes in data set
n <- 129
# mean
p <- y/n; round(p,3)
# CI
round(p - qnorm(0.975)*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n),3) ; round(p + qnorm(0.975)*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n),3)
```

## Question 2

Assume a Beta(1,1) prior on $\theta$. Calculate the posterior mean for $\hat{\theta}$ and 95% credible interval.

```{r}
# Use uniform prior, thus Beta(1,1)
a <- b <- 1
# mean
round((a+y)/(a+b+n), 3)
# Bayes quantile-based CI:
round(qbeta(c(0.025,0.975), y+a, n-y+b),3)
```

## Question 3

Now assume a Beta(10,10) prior on $\theta$. What is the interpretation of this prior? Are we assuming we know more, less or the same amount of information as the prior used in Question 2?

- We are assuming we observe 10 women who are happy and 10 women who are not. This is more information than Beta(1,1).

## Question 4

Create a graph in ggplot which illustrates

- The likelihood (easiest option is probably to use `geom_histogram` to plot the histogram of appropriate random variables)
- The priors and posteriors in question 2 and 3 (use `stat_function` to plot these distributions)

Comment on what you observe. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
p1 <- ggplot(data = tibble(x = seq(0, 1, by = 0.001)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1), aes(color = "Beta(1,1) prior")) + 
  stat_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(shape1 = y+1, shape2 = n-y+1), aes(color = "Beta(1,1) posterior")) + 
    stat_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(shape1 = 10, shape2 = 10), aes(color = "Beta(10,10) prior")) + 
  stat_function(fun = dbeta, args = list(shape1 = y+10, shape2 = n-y+10), aes(color = "Beta(10,10) posterior")) + 
  geom_histogram(data = tibble(x = rbinom(n*2, n = n, p)/(n*2)), aes(x = x, y = ..density.., fill = 'likelihood'), alpha = 0.3, binwidth = 0.015)+
  ylab("") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "distribution")+
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "")
p1
```

## Question 5

(No R code required) A study is performed to estimate the effect of a simple training program on basketball free-throw shooting. A random sample of 100 college students is recruited into the study. Each student first shoots 100 free-throws to establish a baseline success probability. Each student then takes 50 practice shots each day for a month. At the end of that time, each student takes 100 shots for a final measurement. Let $\theta$ be the average improvement in success probability. $\theta$ is measured as the final proportion of shots made minus the initial proportion of shots made. 

Given two prior distributions for $\theta$ (explaining each in a sentence):

- A noninformative prior, and

- A subjective/informative prior based on your best knowledge


Answer:

- Noninformative prior: U(-1,1)
- Informative prior: I believe people are likely to improve, so I'm going to put a Normal prior with mean centered at 0.5 (50% improvement) with a SD of 0.1.
