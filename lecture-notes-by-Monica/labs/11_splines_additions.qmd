# Overview

In this lab you'll be fitting a second-order P-Splines regression model to foster care entries by state in the US, projecting out to 2030. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(rstan)
library(tidybayes)
source(here("code/getsplines.R"))
```

Here's the data

```{r}
d <- read_csv(here("data/fc_entries.csv"))
```

## Question 1

Make a plot highlighting trends over time by state. Might be a good opportunity to use `geofacet`. Describe what you see in a couple of sentences. 


```{r}
library(geofacet)

d |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, ent_pc)) + 
  geom_line()+
  facet_geo(~state, scales = "free_y")

```


## Question 2

Fit a hierarchical second-order P-Splines regression model to estimate the (logged) entries per capita over the period 2010-2017. The model you want to fit is

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{st} &\sim N(\log \lambda_{st}, \sigma^2_{y,s})\\
\log \lambda_{st} &= \alpha_kB_k(t)\\
\Delta^2\alpha_k &\sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\alpha,s})\\
\log \sigma_{\alpha,s} &\sim N(\mu_{\sigma}, \tau^2)
\end{aligned}
$$
Where $y_{s,t}$ is the logged entries per capita for state $s$ in year $t$. Use cubic splines that have knots 2.5 years apart and are a constant shape at the boundaries. Put standard normal priors on standard deviations and hyperparameters. 


```{r}
years <- unique(d$year)
N <- length(years)
y <- log(d |> 
  select(state, year, ent_pc) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "state", values_from = "ent_pc") |> 
  select(-year) |> 
  as.matrix())

res <- getsplines(years, 2.5)
B <- res$B.ik
K <- ncol(B)

stan_data <- list(N = N, y = y, K = K, S = length(unique(d$state)),
                  B = B)

mod <- stan(data = stan_data, file = "../code/models/lab11.stan")
```


## Question 3

Project forward entries per capita to 2030. Pick 4 states and plot the results (with 95% CIs). Note the code to do this in R is in the lecture slides. 


## Question 4 (bonus)

P-Splines are quite useful in structural time series models, when you are using a model of the form 
$$
f(y_t) = \text{systematic part} + \text{time-specific deviations}
$$
where the systematic part is model with a set of covariates for example, and P-splines are used to smooth data-driven deviations over time. Consider adding covariates to the model you ran above. What are some potential issues that may happen in estimation? Can you think of an additional constraint to add to the model that would overcome these issues?
