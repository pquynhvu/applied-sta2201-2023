Intercensal estimates are produced using counts from two consecutive censuses adjusted for CNU (including IER) and postcensal estimates.,,,,
2,"Estimates are final intercensal up to 2015, final postcensal from 2016 to 2020, updated postcensal for 2021 and preliminary postcensal for 2022.",,,,
3,Data for persons aged 90 to 100 years and over will be available from 2001.,,,,
